## General Use<br>
Whenever you start a game, your and opponnent (last played by god type) deck will automatically be updated.<br>

Once you're in a game, the top button will bring you to your opponents gudecks.com page, which will allow you to look at their decks if you want to.<br>

Finally, the settings page can be used to change the text font/size as well as transparency. 
Also, if your log folder is in a weird spot (or you aren't on Windows), you'll need to update the path to the file there. 
The path that you should provide is the folder above the folders where log files are kept (it should be ".../FuelGames" without the quotes). 
This will allow the tracker to automatically use the most recently modified folder, which means that you won't need to update every time the game changes.<br>

I believe that this should work with any OS that can run Python (which is pretty much anything normal), 
but if you're on Mac/Linux, I'd really appreciate if you tell me if it works or not for you!
